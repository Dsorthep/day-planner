Homework #5

This assignment was to create a day planner. 

The day planner should display the current date underneath the heading using moment.js. 

The planner should have input forms for every hour of a 9-5 work day. 

There should be a save button for the user to save their planned events/appts for each hour.

The input boxes should change colors to notify the user of hours/events that have passed during the day.

The input should be stored to local storage as well.
